Eastern guard tower 
glints in sunset; convicts rest 
like lizards on rocks.
The piano man 
is stingy at 3 A.M. 
his songs drop like plum.
Morning sun slants cell 
drunks stagger like cripple flies 
on jailhouse floor.
To write a blues song 
is to regiment riots 
and pluck gems from graves.
A bare pecan tree 
slips a pencil shadow down 
a moonlit snow slope.
The falling snow flakes 
cannot blunt the hard aches nor 
match the steel stillness.
Under moon shadows 
a tall boy flashes knife and 
slices star bright ice.
In the August grass 
struck by the last rays of sun 
the cracked teacup screams.
Making jazz swing in 
seventeen syllables AIN’T 
no square poet’s job.
Clouds murmur darkly,
it is a blinding habit
gazing at the moon.
Spring means plum blossoms
and spotless new kimonos
for holiday whores.
Once more as I wait
for you, night and icy wind
melt into cold rain.
New Year’s morning
everything is in blossom!
I feel about average.
A huge frog and I
staring at each other
neither of us moves.
This moth saw brightness
in a woman’s chamber
burned to a crisp.
Asked how old he was
the boy in the new kimono
stretched out all five fingers.
Blossoms at night
like people
moved by music.
Napped half the day
no one
punished me.
From now on
it’s all clear profit
every sky.
Don’t worry, spiders
I keep house
casually.
These sea slugs
they just don’t seem
Japanese.
Bright autumn moon
pond snails crying
in the saucepan.
Green and speckled legs
Hop on logs and lily pads
Splash in cool water.
In a pouch I grow
on a southern continent
strange creatures I know.
Easter bunny hides
Easter eggs are out of sight
kids look everywhere.
Spring is in the air
flowers are blooming sky high
children are laughing.
Sand scatters the beach
waves crash on the sandy shore
blue water shimmers.
Snowflakes are our friends
they descend when winter comes
making white blankets.
Hearts represent love
jove is a beautiful thing
Valentine's Day love.
An old silent pond
a frog jumps into the pond
splash! silence again.
Autumn moonlight
a worm digs silently
into the chestnut.
In the twilight rain
these brilliant-hued hibiscus
a lovely sunset.
A summer river being crossed
how pleasing
with sandals in my hands!
Light of the moon
moves west flowers shadows
creep eastward.
In the moonlight
the color and scent of the wisteria
seems far away.
O snail
climb Mount Fuji
but slowly, slowly!
Trusting the Buddha, good and bad
I bid farewell
to the departing year.
Everything I touch
with tenderness, alas
pricks like a bramble.
I want to sleep
swat the flies
softly please.
After killing
a spider how lonely I feel
in the cold of night!
For love and for hate
I swat a fly and offer it
to an ant.
A mountain village
under the piled-up snow
the sound of water.
Night and once again
the while I wait for you cold wind
turns into rain.
The summer river
although there is a bridge my horse
goes through the water.
A lightning flash
between the forest trees
I have seen water.
The lamp once out
cool stars enter
the window frame.
Plum flower temple
voices rise
from the foothills
The crow has flown away
swaying in the evening sun
a leafless tree.
From across the lake
past the black winter trees
faint sounds of a flute.
Lily
out of the water
out of itself.
Ground squirrel
balancing its tomato
on the garden fence.
Nightfall
too dark to read the page
too cold.
Just friends
he watches my gauze dress
blowing on the line.
A little boy sings
on a terrace, eyes aglow
ridge spills upward.
Meteor shower
a gentle wave
wets our sandals.
Round lumps of cells grow
up to love porridge later
become The Supremes.
